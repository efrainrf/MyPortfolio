# MyPortfolio
This is a place where I can link all of the projects I will do for this coding bootcamp. 
This challenge really pushed me to do things that I was not familiar with but in the end I am somewhat proud at what I was able to put out. Especially since it was all made from scratch.
The works that I have linked are not all completed its just the progress that I've made on them to that point.
